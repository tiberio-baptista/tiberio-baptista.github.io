#+TITLE: TB Hub
#+SUBTITLE: A little personal static website written in Org mode within Emacs.

* Welcome
My name is Tibério Baptista. I was born and raised in São Miguel, the biggest island in the Azores archipelago. It's great, give us a visit! We love you and *especially* your money!

* About Me
I am a master's in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics_engineering][Informatics Engineering]] in Aveiro, Portugal. Essencially, it's a lot of programming and web development based around databases and stored information/data. Some of the stuff I learned includes:
1. General knowledge with multiple programming languages (Python, Java, C, C++, Javascript, ...);
2. Software development patterns;
3. Working with SQL and NoSQL databases;
4. Development of web servers using frameworks such as Django, Spring Boot, ...;
5. Microservices-based development of software solutions:
   1) Bare metal / virtual machine services;
   2) Service containerization via Docker;
   3) Deployment of distributed, and redundant solutions via Kubernetes.
It was a good course that taught me a bit of a lot, the expression "jack of all trades" is a nice fit for those who graduate.

Other than what I've learned in Aveiro, I also took a fondness for Linux, starting out with Ubuntu and currently adopting Arch. It's a rough learning curve, but it has been quite satisfying.
* This Website
The purpose of this website is to serve as a self-introduction and as a personal stash of Linux knowledge.

I've always wanted to make my own website, though I'm not a big fan of HTML/Javascript. Thankfully I've been slowly diving into Linux, going from being better as a poweruser to starting to grasp Vim, and now... playing with Doom Emacs.

For now I'm mostly toying and experimenting with Doom Emacs' Org mode. Later on, this website will look a lot better and include more relevant info, such as personal projects and articles.

* WIP
This is the site for now. Look at this cool image: [[file:imgs/7871-demomium.gif]] I think it adds quality to this webpage.
